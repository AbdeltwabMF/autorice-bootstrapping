# Auto Rice Boostrapping

Installation Script for My Arch Linux Meta-Distribution.


## What is it?

It is a script that `autoinstalls` and `autoconfigures` a fully-functioning and minimal Arch Linux environment.
It can be run on a fresh install of `Arch` or `Artix` Linux, and provides you with a fully configured diving-board for work or more customizations.
